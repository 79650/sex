# What are Fast-Flags?

**FastFlags (often shortened as FFlags) are internal toggleable options that control whether certain parts of Roblox’s source code should be executed or not.**

**In Roblox, the Engine Settings make use of this FastFlag system. It allows Roblox engineers to dynamically modify the game engine without releasing a full update, typically for [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) or controlled feature rollouts. All FastFlags and their behaviors are defined by Roblox engineers, and a large list of them is loaded online when the client starts up.**

**Realistically, FastFlags are only intended for Roblox engineers during local testing. That said, they can sometimes offer useful functionality for example, exposing advanced graphics options where Roblox’s defaults fall short.**
> [!CAUTION]
> **Using FastFlags should be treated as operating in a kind of “superuser mode.” Superusers have the ability to break things: if you enable the wrong flag, you might cause Roblox Studio or the client to malfunction. In such cases, it wouldn’t usually count as a valid bug report unless you are certain that it’s connected to an upcoming feature and Roblox is unaware of the issue.**

# Will using this get me banned?

**Short answer: No, it won’t. We are 100% sure of it, and even [Roblox Staff have confirmed that fact.](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/welcoming-byfron-to-roblox/2018233/693?u=xtremeguy2256 ) Bootstrappers are not exploit software and have nothing to do with exploiting.**
> **But if you are still using abusive FFlags (such as Noclip, JumpBoost, or Visual Glitches), people can detect this and report you, which may result in a ban.**

<h2>What sites/bot are available for finding Fast-Flags?</h2>

**[FVariables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker/roblox/FVariables.txt) ~ A sorted list of fast variables, which are used by Roblox to toggle changes to the engine remotely on multiple platforms without having to redeploy the client**

**[Flemish FastFlags](https://discord.gg/UHfwyxjeya) ~ This bot brings together all the features in one place. Instead of using separate tools like FVariables, you can access and use every FastFlag-related function through simple commands**

<details>
<summary><h2>Fast-Flags Tips-Explanations</h2></summary>

> 1. Roblox is mainly a CPU based game.
> 2. You can find fastflags in the Roblox Dev Console Memory.
> 3. FLogDebugShowFlagState is 90% correct; it only turns 100% correct when you join a game.
> 4. Having overlays can actually harm FPS, so yes. `FFlagDebugDisplayFPS` can actually reduce FPS.
> 5. Disabling **all** `telemetry`, will not do anything in terms of performance. It will also cause visual and other bugs.

> **Fast Integer**
> - **Type:** Integer (`-2147483648` to `2147483647`)
> - **Description:** A static integer that is initialized once and remains unchanged throughout the session. It only updates when a new session starts.

### `DFInt`
> **Dynamic Fast Integer**
> - **Type:** Integer (`-2147483648` to `2147483647`)
> - **Description:** A dynamic integer that can be updated during runtime. It refreshes automatically every 5 minutes to reflect any changes.

### `SFFlag`
> **Synchronized Fast Flag**
> **Type:** Boolean (`true/false`) or Integer (`-2147483648` to `2147483647`)
> **Description:** A synchronized flag variable that is loaded by the server and sent to the client. It ensures that the flag’s state is consistent across different clients. The flag's value is forced by the server and cannot be changed by the client (you).
